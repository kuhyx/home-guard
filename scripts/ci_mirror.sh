# ci_mirror.sh — run the exact CI gates locally before a push can leave.
#
# Why: the installed pre-commit hook only checks *staged* files, and the local
# dev environment already has every dependency installed. CI does neither — it
# runs `pre-commit run --all-files` and installs a fresh environment from
# requirements.txt. That gap is why green-locally repos went red in CI
# (missing runtime deps, --all-files lint debt, order-dependent test flakes).
#
# This script reproduces both CI workflows on the developer machine:
#   1. a venv built ONLY from requirements.txt (mirrors the Tests workflow's
#      `pip install -r requirements.txt`), rebuilt only when requirements.txt
#      changes (hash-gated so day-to-day pushes stay fast);
#   2. `pre-commit run --all-files` (mirrors the pre-commit workflow);
#   3. `python -m pytest` inside that clean venv (mirrors Tests);
#   4. `flutter analyze` + `flutter test` for the companion app in app/.
#
# The app is gated here rather than only by pre-commit because pre-commit has
# no Dart hooks at all: without this, the app's tests were never run by
# anything automatic, and a red app/ could be pushed with a green gate.
#
# Wired as the pre-push hook, so a red result blocks the push before CI ever
# sees it. Escape hatch for genuine emergencies: `git push --no-verify`.
